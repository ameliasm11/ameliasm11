Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Amelia,
I have 2+ years of working experience related to the Software QA position with hands-on experience in Mobile (iOS & Android) and Web applications testing, also API Testing. Talent to analyze problem, evaluate and recommends alternatives to solve issues. Project management tool using Jira. I also love to learn something new to upgrade my skills and knowledge.

I have big interest in Software Testing. Also currently I'm upgrading my skill and knowledge by learning about Java and Automation Test using Katalon and a little bit about Cucumber Selenium Java.
